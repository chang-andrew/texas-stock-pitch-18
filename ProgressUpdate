Hi!

So in the code, I've kind of added comments and like changed the texts to indicate ideas I had.
For example, one section had these squares with hover-over animations, thought we might be able to use that for sponsors.

Was trying to rip the UMICH schedule thingy, but it's really broken, so maybe if we downloaded all their style sheets and 
then used their code verbatim? Haha, not sure.

Also, I don't know if this is just when trying to load locally, but the bootstrap at the top of page is broken, not sure
if worth to fix :(
